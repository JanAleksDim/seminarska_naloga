# naloga_4
Naloga 4 - I wrote all the comments in English instead of Slovenian because it's a matter of standard best practice. 

I copied the first assignment and changed it to fit the second assignment's guidelines.

I found a website that offers widgets and got one of their free models and used it in the project then I found some royalty free music and added it in.

I made three Input element windows, one for your name, one for your email and one for your phone number.
